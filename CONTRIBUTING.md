## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- OS: Linux or macOS
- JDK: openjdk 12.0.2. Installation instructions for Mac and Linux can be found in [our wiki](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/wiki/Installing-OpenJDK-12.0.2-for-Mac-and-Linux)
- IDE: [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)(recommended) or equivalent IDE

### Familiarize yourself with SuperTokens
1. [Architecture of SuperTokens](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/wiki/SuperTokens-Architecture)
2. [SuperTokens code and file structure overview](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/wiki/Code-and-file-structure-overview)
3. [Versioning methodology](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/wiki/Versioning,-git-and-releases)


### Project Setup
1. Fork the [supertokens-core](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core) repository
2. `git clone https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-root.git`
3. `cd supertokens-root`
4. Open the `modules.txt` file in an editor:
    - The `modules.txt` file contains the core, plugin-interface, the type of plugin and their branches(versions) 
    - By default the `master` branch is used but you can change the branch depending on which version you want to modify 
    - The `sqlite-plugin` is used as the default plugin as it is an in-memory database and requires no setup
      - [core](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core)
      - [plugin-interface](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-plugin-interface)
      - [sqlite-plugin](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-sqlite-plugin)
      - Check the repository branches by clicking on the links listed above, click the branch tab and check for all the available versions 
    - Add your github `username` separated by a ',' after `core,master` in  `modules.txt`
    - If, for example, your github `username` is `helloworld` then modules.txt should look like...  
      ```
      // put module name like module name,branch name,github username(if contributing with a forked repository) and then call ./loadModules script        
      core,master,helloworld  
      plugin-interface,master        
      sqlite-plugin,master
      ```
	
5. Run loadModules to clone the required repositories  
`./loadModules`
6. Create a directory called sqlite_db, this directory is required to run tests with the sqlite-plugin  
`mkdir sqlite_db`


## Modifying code
1. Open `supetokens-root` in your IDE
2. After gradle has imported all the dependencies you can start modifying the code  

## Testing  
1. Navigate to the `supertokens-root` repository  
2. Run all tests   
`./startTestingEnv`  
3. If all tests pass the terminal should display  
- core tests:  
![core tests passing](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-logo/blob/master/images/core-tests-passing.png)  
- plugin tests:  
![plugin tests passing](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-logo/blob/master/images/plugin-tests-passing.png)
